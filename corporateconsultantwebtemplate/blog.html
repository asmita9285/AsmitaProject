								<h2><a href="blog.html">My Journey in Japan so far.</a></h2>
								<p>
								
								<p>
									I am a 22 years old currently living in a Tokyo, Japan. I came to Japan 2 years ago with no idea how to speak Japanese. I definetly experienced a huge culture shock at first. Since, Nepal and Japan is completely opposite despite being an Asian Country, you can definetily find a huge difference in both of the countrys culture.

									I started by part-time job for the first time in my life because we dont have working part time culture in Nepal. I started by working in a Japanese Restaurant that is located in Ginza, Tokyo. It was known to be one of the most renowed expensive restaurant. I had to experience with the workplace bully because I did not know Japanese. That was the time I had a wrong image of Japanese people. I quit that job and started somewhere else, even though I did not get bullied, still I was treated as a foreigner or the outsider. Moral of the story: You will never get treated same as Japanese when you are in Japan and still you will feel the difference in their behaviour.
